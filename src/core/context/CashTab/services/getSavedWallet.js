 * Retrieves the list of saved wallets from local storage, excluding the active wallet.

 * This function checks for the 'savedWallets' entry in local storage using `localforage`. 
 * If it doesn't exist or thereâ€™s an error, an empty array is returned. It also ensures that
 * the active wallet (if passed) is not included in the returned list of saved wallets.

 * @param {Wallet} activeWallet - The currently active wallet, which will be excluded from the list of saved wallets.
 * 
 * @returns {Promise<Wallet[]>} A promise that resolves to an array of saved wallet objects, excluding the active wallet.
 * Each wallet object is expected to have a `name` property.
