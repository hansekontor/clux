You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Production

## Implementation
Include the following script:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://domain/checkout-v0.1.js"></script>
```

To render the checkout popup, run the following script with a valid paymentUrl. Modify the callback functions to your needs. Success callback has the final transaction id as input.

```html
<script>
    Checkout({ 
        paymentUrl: "https://pay.badger.cash/i/KP4E9",
        onSuccess: function(link) {
            console.log("Success, link:", link);
        },
        onCancel: function() {
            console.log("payment canceled");
        }
    }).render();
</script>
```
